# Analysis Phase

This project is about the authentication and authorization of users. Every user must have an access_id, a username, password, a name.
A system class must exist where all the users are stored.
When the programm starts, the authentication process must begin where the user is asked about his username & password. This is the only thing that the authenticator is allowed to do.
After the authentication process, the authorization process starts where a list of actions is assigned to the user depending on his access_id.
