# Chapter 2: Objects in Python 

A module is nothing but a python file.
A package is a folder with more modules inside of it. In order for a folder to be considered a package, it needs a \_\_init.py\_\_ that is normally always empty.

There are 2 types of imports:

1. Absolute imports
2. Relative imports

Let's take the following directory as example:

```
parent_directory\
    main.py
    ecommerce\
        __init__.py
        database.py
        products.py
        payments\
            __init__.py
            paypal.py
            authorizenet.py
```

Before I explain what each type of import does and how to implement each of them, I will explain what actually happens when we write import. Python uses ```sys.path``` to search for modules. This is what sys.path looks like:

![sys path](screenshots_for_notes/Chapter2_screenshots/sys_path.PNG)

So the first path is the path that our current file is inside of. The rest are default directories where modules might be stored. That means that we can add a new path to sys.path where python can look inside for modules.

#### 1. Absolute imports

When using absolute imports you must give the entire path of the module you want to import. For example if you are inside ```main.py``` and you want to import ```ecommerce/database.py``` you'll have to give the entire path, including the package name:

```Python
# Inside main.py
import ecommerce.database
# In case you only need certain things out of the module and not the entire module you can use from * import *
from ecommerce.database import Database
```

If we want to import ```main.py``` from inside of ```ecommerce/database.py``` you have to add the directory of main to sys.path otherwise it won't work.

```Python
import sys
import os

current_file = os.path.realpath(__file__)
current_dir = os.path.dirname(current_file)
parent_dir = os.path.dirname(current_dir)
sys.path.insert(0, parent_dir)

import main
```

In our case the directory of main is the parent directory, we can also manually insert the name of the directory.

#### 2. Relative imports

When using relative imports you can give the relative path to the module and you can also go back in other directories which is something that you can't do with absolute imports. Here is an example:

Let's say that you are inside ```database.py``` and you want to import ```main.py```:

```Python
# from .. import main 
from ..main import MainClass
# if you only want to import one class then use from ..main import MainClass

class Database:
    pass
```

The way you run the files that use relative imports has to be different. You have to be outside the parent directory and run it at a script ```-m``` and write the path correctly ( with . not / ):

```python -m parent_directory.ecommerce.database```
